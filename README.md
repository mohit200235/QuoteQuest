QuoteQuest is an Android app that provides daily inspirational quotes. Users can read and refresh quotes, receive daily notifications, and enjoy beautiful background images. This project is developed using Android Studio and Java.

 # Features
 - Displays daily inspirational quotes.
 - Allows users to refresh and load more quotes.
 - Provides daily notifications with new quotes.
 - Shows visually appealing background images with each quote.

 # Technologies Used
- Android Studio
- Java
- Retrofit for API requests
- Picasso for image loading

# How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in Android Studio.
- Build and run the app on an Android emulator or device.

# Code Structure
The project is organized into several packages:

 - com.example.tester: Contains the main activity (MainActivity), splash screen activity (SplashScreen), and the broadcast receiver for notifications (MyReceiver).
 - com.example.tester.adapter: Contains the RecyclerViewAdapter used to populate the quotes in the RecyclerView.

# How the App Works
1. When the app is launched, it displays a splash screen with an image and progress bar. After 5 seconds, it automatically navigates to the main activity.

2. The main activity (MainActivity) displays a RecyclerView of inspirational quotes with background images. Users can pull to refresh to get new quotes or scroll to load more quotes.

3. The app also schedules a daily notification using the AlarmManager and MyReceiver. When the notification is triggered, it displays the latest inspirational quote.

# API Integration

The app fetches quotes and background images from an API. It uses Retrofit for making network requests to the API.

# Notifications
The app sends daily notifications with inspirational quotes using the Android Notification system. The notification content includes the quote text and an image.

# Dependencies
 - Retrofit
 - Picasso
 - AndroidX
   
# Future Improvements
 - Allow users to save their favorite quotes.
 - Implement user authentication and cloud synchronization for saved quotes.
 - Add more categories of quotes.
 - Improve the UI/UX.

# Configuration
To use this app with your own OpenWeatherMap API key, replace the KEY variable in the MainActivity class with your API key: The app uses several libraries and dependencies, including:

private final static String KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
